MipsDis 1.0 is a Mips32 disassembler for ELF binaries whose binary sections are stripped.

For installation instructions please read `INSTALL'.
For license information please read `COPYING'.
Homepage: http://lethalman.hostei.com/mipsdis.html

How it works:
MipsDis will read a Mips32 ELF binary executable. It will disassemble binaries without a table of sections.
This table is used to determinate the offset inside the binary of the TEXT and RODATA segments which contain instructions and strings.
MipsDis will guess the offsets of these sections and disassemble the binary showing the assembly code on standard output.
Comments on each line are copied from Mips32 instructions specification.
